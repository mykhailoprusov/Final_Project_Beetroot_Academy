<h1> Best supplements for muscle gain </h1>

<hr>

<h3>Whey Protein Powder</h3>

<p>If your aim is building muscles then whey protein is a great place to start.

Whey protein is derived from milk, as a liquid by-product of the cheese making process.

Whey protein contains all nine of the essential amino acids which form the building blocks of our muscles.

Whey can help you increase strength and gain muscle fast, as well as losing significant amounts of body fat, when teamed with a regular exercise routine.1</p>



<h3>Avocado Toast with Cottage Cheese</h3>

<p>This quick and easy toast is great for breakfast or a snack, perfect for those busy weekday mornings. The cottage cheese is packed with protein and compliments the avocado with delightful sweetness, all on a bed of whatever bread you fancy. Balanced, easy and delicious- you’ll find yourself making this toast most mornings!</p>



<h3>Casein</h3>

<p>Similar to whey, casein is also a protein from milk. Casein is the solid curds which are removed from curdled milk when cheese is made. It has the same amino acid protein as whey but it absorbed less quickly.

Since it has a slow absorption rate, casein helps your cells to synthesise protein, even when your body might usually be breaking down muscle to feed itself..2</p>



<h3>Creatine</h3>

<p>Creatine is one of the most effective supplements you can take to increase physical performance during high-intensity exercise.

Creatine is a chemical protein, which is found naturally within the body in muscle cells and within the brain. It helps to produce energy for everyday tasks, as well as exercise.

Because it provides your muscles with more energy, you will be able to exercise for longer.

Monohydrate creatine is the creatine that is contained in most supplements.</p>



<h3>Breakfast BLT Salad</h3>

<p>Salad for breakfast is an unconventional but protein-rich breakfast idea that we are currently loving. Pack your bowl with all the good stuff like kale, bacon, avocado, tomato and most importantly- eggs. It’s all your breakfast favourites without the bread, in a bowl! It may take a while getting used to, but once you’ve tried this salad for breakfast there’s no going back.</p>



<h3>Weight gainers</h3>

<p>If you are looking to gain mass then this is the supplement for you.

Weight gain supplements, also known as mass gainers, are the ideal choice if you are very slender and struggle to put on weight or if you want to build a lot of muscle and quickly.

Mass gainers are an excellent addition to a bodybuilding diet.

Weight gainers are very similar to other protein supplements. However, they are very high in carbohydrates and calories which helps you to gain weight.5

In order to build muscle whilst using weight gainers, you need to ensure that you can do the training to match.</p>
